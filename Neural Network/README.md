# Neural Network

## A study in neural networks using MaxMSP

Train a model to predict if a piece of music is in a major or minor key.

The example uses Bach's [Well-Tempered Clavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier) as the training data.

It looks at the frequency of each pitch class (ie. how often each note in the scale is played, and the ratio between those values)
